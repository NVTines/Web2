    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">In 2021, adidas and Parley are joining forces on A Mission for our Oceans to address the impact plastic is having on marine ecosystems and coastal communities. This journey kicked off in April by bringing awareness to the 350 million tons of virgin plastic produced every year, polluting some of the most remote places on Earth—from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">To raise awareness about the issue and inspire people to take action—whether by reducing plastic consumption or actively removing it from nature—adidas Ultramarathon athlete and climate activist Timothy Olson dedicated his attempt at breaking the record for fastest run of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) to the cause. With the current record set at 53 days, 6 hours, and 37 minutes, he is aiming to run over 50 miles a day for 50 days.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">In the latest mission adidas x Parley continue the conversation to raise awareness about the pervasive plastic in our oceans through a three-part episodic series.</p>
    <p style="padding:10px 40px;font-weight: bold">Episode 1: Power of Sport as a Catalyst of Change.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">Returning for a fourth year between May 28 – June 8, adidas and Parley’s global impact platform saw its largest participation yet. To-date, adidas x Parley Run for the Oceans has united over 8 million runners around the world, collectively clocking up 81.6 million KMs and raising $2.5 million to help Parley develop its initiatives and educational programs in the fight against marine plastic pollution - a tangible solution that results in clear impact.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">In 2019, 92 schools were enrolled in the program and are now education hubs, as well as plastic interception points for the local community. As a result, 70,000 kids and their families are participating in the program.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">Parley Ocean Uprise and the Ocean Uprise Youth Leadership Camp was created to inspire young people to learn about plastic waste and become ocean activists. From engaging lessons, to films, to hands-on experiences, these programs educate the next generation about the state of our oceans.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">Run for the Oceans support also enabled the scale and reach of The Parley Global Cleanup Network which is active in 30 countries and counting where volunteers take direct action against marine plastic pollution by removing plastic waste from beaches, remote islands, rivers, mangroves and high seas, and intercept plastic waste in coastal communities.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;padding:10px 40px;text-indent: 50px">The latest adidas x Parley collection of apparel and footwear is made in part with Parley Ocean Plastic. Just one of the innovations that represent our commitment to help end plastic waste.</p>
